# DemoSQLSnapshot
This WinForms project is a sample for Nuget package DataJuggler.SQLSnapshot, which allows you to export a SQL Server database and all data rows to Excel with just a connection string and a path to save the Excel sheet with a .xlsx extension.

In this video I show you how to export an entire SQL Server database and all data rows using only 3 lines of code (in 18 minutes - I should have created a console app).
